<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I am a first-year college student with a strong interest in coding, science, and design. I enjoy building things, understanding how systems work, and turning ideas into practical projects. This portfolio is my first step toward showcasing my learning journey and the work I am passionate about.</p>
<p>I have always been curious about technology and problem-solving, which led me to explore areas like computer vision and machine learning. I have built an object detection model using the YOLOv8 engine, giving me hands-on experience with real-world applications of AI. Alongside this, I successfully cleared the NDA 154 written examination, which reflects my discipline, focus, and ability to work consistently toward challenging goals.</p>
<p>I am also an active member of the Makerspace Club at my college, where I collaborate with like-minded peers, experiment with ideas, and continue developing my technical and creative skills.</p>
<p>I see learning as a continuous process, and I am always excited to take on new challenges, improve my abilities, and grow through meaningful projects. This website represents the beginning of that journey.</p>
